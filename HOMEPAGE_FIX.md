# Homepage Redirect Issue - Solution

## Problem

When accessing `http://localhost:3000/`, the browser was redirected to `/host` even though the redirect was removed from `next.config.ts`.

## Root Cause

The issue is caused by **Next.js development server caching**. Even after removing the redirect from the configuration, Next.js keeps the old routes in its cache (`.next` directory).

## Solution

### Option 1: Clear Cache and Restart (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
# 2. Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# 3. Restart dev server
pnpm dev

# 4. Clear browser cache
# - Chrome/Edge: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
# - Firefox: Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows)
# - Safari: Cmd+Option+E (Mac)

# 5. Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Window

Open `http://localhost:3000` in an incognito/private window to bypass browser cache.

### Option 3: Test the Build

```bash
# Build and start production server
pnpm build
pnpm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## Verification

Run the test script to verify everything is configured correctly:

```bash
node test-homepage.mjs
```

This will check:

- ✓ `src/app/page.tsx` exists and exports HomePage
- ✓ No active redirects in `next.config.ts`
- ✓ All homepage components exist

## Why This Happened

1. Previously, `next.config.ts` had:

   ```typescript
   async redirects() {
     return [{ source: '/', destination: '/host', permanent: true }]
   }
   ```

2. This was removed and replaced with:

   ```typescript
   // Redirects removed - homepage now shows proper landing page
   ```

3. However, Next.js cached the redirect configuration in:
   - `.next/routes-manifest.json`
   - `.next/cache/`
   - Browser cache

4. The dev server continued using the cached redirect until the cache was cleared.

## Current Homepage Structure

The homepage now displays:

- **HeroSection**: Full-screen hero with search bar
- **CategorySection**: 4 accommodation type cards
- **HowItWorksSection**: 4-step process explanation

All components are in `/src/components/homepage/`.

## Important Notes

- **Production builds** (`pnpm build`) always work correctly because they rebuild from scratch
- **Development mode** (`pnpm dev`) uses aggressive caching for performance
- Always clear cache when modifying Next.js configuration files
- Browser cache can also cause issues - use hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

## If Still Not Working

1. Check browser developer console for errors
2. Verify you're not logged in (logout and try again)
3. Try a different browser
4. Check if there's a service worker registered:
   - Chrome DevTools → Application → Service Workers
   - Unregister any service workers
5. Restart your computer (clears all caches)
