## Temporary Placeholders

For testing purposes, the components will gracefully handle missing images with solid color backgrounds and gradients. However, for the best user experience, please add real images as soon as possible.

## Image Optimization Tips

- Use WebP or AVIF format for better compression
- Recommended dimensions: 1920px width for hero, 800px for categories
- Optimize images before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh)
- Keep file sizes under 500KB per image when possible
